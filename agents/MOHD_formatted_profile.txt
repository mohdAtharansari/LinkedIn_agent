I also specialize in building robust AI architectures capable of delivering high-quality responses with exceptional speed.

**Experience:**

1. **AI Engineer** at Dheyo AI (6/2024 - Present)
    * [No description provided]

2. **Teaching Assistant** at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (8/2022 - 5/2024)
    * [No description provided]

3. **Data Science Intern** at Maritime Research Center (5/2023 - 7/2023)
    * The goal was to create a machine learning model for estimating nutrient concentrations in Indian rivers. Due to data scarcity for Indian rivers, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was first developed using a Chinese river dataset. Then, transfer learning was employed to adapt the model to the limited Ganga river data. This innovative approach yielded a powerful model capable of predicting nutrient levels in Indian rivers, contributing to a better understanding of the environment and conservation efforts.

4. **Data Analyst ** at Gurucool (1/2023 - 3/2023)
    * • Analyzed the data given by the organization, delivered valuable insights, and performed web scraping to obtain relevant data
